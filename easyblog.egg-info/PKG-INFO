        Introduction
        ------------
        EasyBlog is just a test for pyramid. Main goal is to test different features of pyramid. During development I was asked to create a webpage that contains Authorization-policy, user-management, blogging and news. So I let this project to fulfill those requirements. After a little bit of refactoring it's not a test-project anymore. 
        
        EasyBlog uses ZODB and traversal. Main reason for that is my experience from Plone and Zope. And yes, I like OO-databases. 
        
        Layout is taken from freewebtemplates.com and is designed by Dcarter Design. So let's give them some credits for that. The layout is integrated to pyramid using compass (CSS-framework that uses SASS). 
        
        Products I've used for developing:
            * pyramid_simpleform 
            * compass
        
        
        Small code-explanation:
            models.py 
                includes all the models which will act as "resources" in our resource tree.
            views.py 
                all the views goes to here.
            schemas.py 
                schemas for pyramid_simpleform. All the form validation code goes here
            interfaces.py 
                mostly for marker interfaces.
            tests.py 
                all the tests. I'm trying to keep up 100% test-coverage.
            config.py 
                (hardcode stuff. We should remove this after the project is finished)
            __init__.py 
                configuration for our project.
            subscribers.py 
                events goes here
            utilities.py 
                some tools we've created to support views and models
            security.py 
                contains security-related code like permission handling, password hashing etc
